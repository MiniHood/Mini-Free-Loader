- Load Library Injector

Compile x86 on Release with Multi Byte 

Probably the most high quality protected loader your going to get for free... 

# Want to make a p2c?
add a download function and then make it download to a dll path and inject from that dll path... ez sells.

This loader is far from perfect and is in fact one of the worst I've made... Sure it has pretty good anti debug and other features but it's easily crackable since it stores the DLL on disk so you should probably research how to use byte array injection
such as: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-and-c/73012-remote-inject-module-byte-array.html

Like I said I do not recommend this for a p2c of any kind... Unless it's just friends you trust.
